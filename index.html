            <p id="presentation">Hello, my name is <strong>William Giovanni Tovar Parra</strong>  market technology student; I am going to explain some of the strategies to introduce our product to the market in this city.</p>
            <h2 class="titulo-centralizado">About our product</h2>
            <p id="product"><em>Our product is a lunch that comes in different presentations, it is made with top quality and very healthy ingredients, in ready-to-eat or ready-to-take home points of sale, it allows its refrigeration and subsequent consumption due to its thermo-sealed packaging.</em></p>
            <p id="product">We can take as a strength the fact that people have busy lives and we can sell our ready-to-eat product to them. In addition, we can work out a way to offering a free home distribution service which help us to boost sales and in turn make the consumer's life easier, which will undoubtedly corner our competitors.</p> 
            <p id="product">The large number of tourist centers and attractions are a plus since it gives us the opportunity to establish a great number of points of sale to promote and position our products and services.</p>
