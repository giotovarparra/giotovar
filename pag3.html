        <div> <h2 class="planimetry">PLANIMETRY</h2>
            <p>The planimetry helps us to determine the location and organization of the points of sale. A deeper study is necessary in terms of space, measurements, content and some additional aspects, since all distributors do not have the same space and distribution.</p>
            <p>The best point is the level of the eyes and that of the hands, it should be noted that they are two preferred places of implantation. Products that are at eye level will attract more attention from buyers and those that are at hand level will be more within reach of the customer, that is, both locations are very good.
